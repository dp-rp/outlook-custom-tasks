## Troubleshooting

### Everything suddenly slower when running rules??

If you're on a laptop or other portable system, your system might have switched over to a power-saving battery profile automatically - this often happens when you take your laptop/device off charge.

Try putting your device on charge to quickly check if that's the source of performance suddenly getting worse.

Depending on your system you should be able to change when different battery profiles are used, but only do this if you know what you're doing. If you really need to run some particularly demanding rules, you may be better off just putting your device on charge.
