## Rule Creator

  - e.g. emails ARE from johnsmith@example.com, however do not contain the word "suburb" in the subject line.
- As a rule creator, I want to be able to sort emails by multiple criteria.
  - e.g. unread emails first, then by sender name, etc.

## Rule Suggestion AI

- As an AI, I should consider any unflagged and unread emails similar to already flagged emails as potentially important and worthy of consideration when suggesting new rules.
